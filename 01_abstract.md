# Scope and Goals
Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) is an open-source middleware framework for developing distributed and modular robotic applications. It has native support for real-time communication, cross-platform compatibility, and easy interfacing with packages like Simulink and MATLAB.

This renders it a perfect middleware for prototyping and deployment of autonomous features in both academic and industrial environments. This research covers the integration and implementation of ROS2 nodes for fusing LiDAR and stereo camera sensors on a Jetson Orin Nano controller. 

The theoretical foundation underlying this project is part of a broader research project named Automated Driving in MIniaturized Traffic scenarios 1:14 (ADMIT14), which are intended to validate autonomous driving technology in a controlled, small-scale environment. In this study, we concentrate on creating a modular configuration, where Python Publishers transmit raw sensor data, and Python subscribers or MATLAB decode them at higher levels. This isolated configuration allows independent development, testing, and replacement of individual hardware components, showcasing the versatility that ROS2 provides.
