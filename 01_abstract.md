# Scope and Goals

In order to develop and test automated driving systems a traffic environment in the scale 1:14 is going to be established

For this purpose a ROS2 environment shall be installed on a Nvidia Jetson Orin Controller. ROS2 nodes have to implemented to read sensor signals (camera, Lidar), exchange information via a CAN-Bus with other controllers and process some data. Whenever possible Simulink and code generations shall be used for the implementation of the ROS nodes.

Conditions:
This project is offered to ASM students at Esslingen University. The work continues predecessor projects and has interfaces to other project teams.
