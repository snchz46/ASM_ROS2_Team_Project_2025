# 1Ô∏è‚É£ ROS 2 Introduction

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible and modular open-source framework for developing robotic applications. It provides the tools, libraries, and conventions needed to build distributed systems where multiple components‚Äîcalled nodes‚Äîcan communicate over well-defined interfaces.

Built to address the limitations of the original ROS, ROS 2 offers real-time capabilities, enhanced security, improved middleware abstraction, and native support for multi-platform systems (Linux, Windows, macOS). It is widely used in research, industrial automation, and autonomous systems.

This guide aims to introduce ROS 2 concepts and provide practical steps for installation, configuration, and development with real examples using sensors like LiDAR and integrations with MATLAB.
