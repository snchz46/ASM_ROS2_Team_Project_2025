ROS2 Package [Full guide](https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_ros/tree/ros2).

After following the guide above, create a new environment and execute these commands on your Ubuntu terminal:

````bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
````
````bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
````
````bash
git clone -b ros2 https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_ros.git
````
````bash
cd ~/ros2_ws/
````
````bash
source /opt/ros/<rosdistro>/setup.bash
````
````bash
colcon build --symlink-install
````
````bash
source ./install/setup.bash
````
````bash
sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
````
````bash
ros2 launch rplidar_ros view_rplidar_a2m8_launch.py
````
After these steps a RViz2 window will appear. Make sure that the topic is set to /scan and the Fixed Frame to "laser"

# Retrieving sensor data from the LiDAR

## Script code to read data from the LiDAR

The following Python script demonstrates a minimal ROS 2 node that subscribes to LiDAR data published on the `/scan` topic. It listens for `LaserScan` messages and logs the distance value at angle 0 (the first index of the scan data) as a simple example.

## LiDAR-Based Obstacle Avoidance Node

This Python script implements a simple obstacle avoidance node for a robot using LiDAR data in ROS 2.  
The node subscribes to the `/scan` topic to receive `LaserScan` messages from the LiDAR sensor and publishes velocity commands to the `/cmd_vel` topic to control the robot's movement.

It analyzes the frontal range of the LiDAR readings, detects obstacles within a specified threshold distance (30 cm), and reacts by either stopping and turning or moving forward if the path is clear.
