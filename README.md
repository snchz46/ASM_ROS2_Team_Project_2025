# ü§ñ Automotive Systems Master Project 2025: ADMIT14 ROS 2 
> A project work by Samuel Sanchez, Master student at Hochschule Esslingen
##  Repository guide

Welcome to this practical and compact guide about ROS 2 and how to implement and integrate an RPLiDAR and a Stereo Camera on a NVIDIA Jetson Nano. 

This project is offered to ASM students at Esslingen University. The work continues predecessor projects and has interfaces to other project teams. 

The theoretical foundation underlying this project is part of a broader research project named Automated Driving in MIniaturized Traffic scenarios 1:14 (ADMIT14), which are intended to validate autonomous driving technology in a controlled, small-scale environment.
